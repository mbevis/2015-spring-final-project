                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>Good day! I am Montana Bevis, and I am a Graphic Designer currently residing in Baltimore. I started my college career at the Community College of Baltimore County, and finished at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County (UMBC). I finally graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s in Graphics Design.  I was originally born in Texas, however thanks to my family being in the military I was able to move throughout the country and visit many great places. At one point I was able to live in Germany for a few months. In my spare time I enjoy painting, drawing, and enjoying the company of my dogs. Below you will find links to both my resume page and a brief project page for a painting of mine.</p>
